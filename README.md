# 🏀 The Cost of Winning: Analyzing NBA Team & Player Efficiency from 2010 to 2024

A data analytics project exploring the relationship between NBA player performance, team efficiency, and salary costs over the past decade and a half.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project answers key questions using real NBA data:
- Do "superteams" generate better ROI?
- Who are the most overpaid and underpaid players based on their on-court impact?
- Which teams get the most value per win?
- Has the cost of success increased in the modern NBA?

We analyze both **team-level** and **player-level** metrics to reveal the hidden cost of winning in the NBA.
